# To Do List

To-Do List applications are widely used for personal and professional task management, making them an essential tool for individuals and teams to stay organized and productive. By creating this program, I aim to provide a practical solution for managing tasks, users, and projects efficiently.



## How to use?

Launch ToDoList.exe

Start by creating new users, projects and tasks for them. For obtaining functionality take a look on documentation.

You also have access to the file "testing" which is pre-filled file that is used in the documentation.

## Lessons Learned

I have developed a task and project management system that allows users to add, delete, and manipulate their tasks and projects. Personally I think this is very important project to develop because it can be used by everyone on daily basis. I really like how I implemented chrono in my project. Firstly I used strings for data types but after implementing some algorithms I understood that it is cringe. My teacher recommended me to use chrono and It was hard to implement firstly but then I successfully understood how it works. I like the functionality of my program. Still it can be expanded a lot. I already know what functions I can implement to extend this project. For example: Changing the status of tasks, other more complex types of sorting and filtering data. I really would like to implement these features but I don’t have enough time to make everything I want :c. Also the hardest part of the project was implementing read and write functions. OMG I spent like 6 hours to make them. Still I am really glad that I successfully completed this project. I have gained extremely huge amount of knowledge out of this. Also I can say that everything was hard from the point of starting the usage of Visual Studio. Managing files, writing complex functions, facing new and new errors…
